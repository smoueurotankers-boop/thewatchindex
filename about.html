            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The Watch Index is an independent initiative dedicated to highlighting the critical issue of 
                <strong>fatigue among seafarers</strong> in the global maritime industry. Our mission is to provide 
                a safe, anonymous platform where maritime professionals can report their real experiences with 
                fatigue, rest violations, and working conditions at sea.
            </p>
            <p>
                By aggregating anonymous data from seafarers worldwide, we aim to create a transparent, data-driven 
                picture of fatigue levels across different vessel types, trading regions, and operational conditions. 
                This information serves as a powerful tool for advocacy, policy reform, and industry awareness.

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Fatigue is one of the most significant safety risks in maritime operations, contributing to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maritime accidents</strong> – Collisions, groundings, and equipment failures</li>
                <li><strong>Health issues</strong> – Physical and mental health deterioration</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced performance</strong> – Impaired decision-making and reaction times</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory violations</strong> – Breaches of international rest hour requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite international regulations like the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC 2006) and STCW requirements, 
                fatigue remains a persistent problem. Many seafarers face pressure to work beyond safe limits, 
                particularly during port operations, cargo handling, and periods of reduced manning.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The Watch Index operates on three core principles:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Complete Anonymity</strong> – We collect zero personally identifying information. No names, vessel details, or company information.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Transparency</strong> – All aggregated metrics are publicly visible on our dashboard, ensuring accountability.</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence-Based Advocacy</strong> – Real data from real seafarers creates undeniable evidence for industry stakeholders and regulators.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Seafarers submit anonymous reports about their sleep hours, rest violations, and working conditions. 
                Our system aggregates this data and presents it through clear visualizations, showing trends across 
                ship types, regions, and time periods.
            </p>

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                The Watch Index is maintained by maritime professionals and advocates who understand the realities 
                of life at sea. We are committed to improving working conditions and safety standards for all seafarers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This platform is independent and not affiliated with any shipping company, flag state, or commercial entity. 
                Our sole focus is on seafarer welfare and maritime safety.
